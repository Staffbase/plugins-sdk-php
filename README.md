# Plugin SDK for PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Staffbase/plugins-sdk-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Staffbase/plugins-sdk-php)

If you are developing your own plugin for your Staffbase app we describe the authentication flow of a plugin at https://developers.staffbase.com/api/plugin-sso/. While this documentation just covers the conceptual ideas of the interface of plugins though – the so called Plugin SSO – we want to provide a library to help you develop your first plugin for Staffbase even faster. This SDK provides the basic functionality to parse and verify a provided token for PHP.

## Installation

We provide our Plugin SDK via Composer (https://packagist.org/packages/staffbase/plugins-sdk-php). Thus, you can just use Composer for installation:

```
composer require staffbase/plugins-sdk-php
```

## Dependencies

Dependencies are also managed by Composer. When using this repository keep the following dependencies in mind (cf. [composer.json](composer.json)):

* php: >=5.5.9
* lcobucci/jwt: ^3.2

## API Reference

For the API reference of this SDK please consult the [docs](doc/api.md).

## Code Example

You can try to create a token from the received jwt.

```php
use Exception;
use Staffbase\plugins\sdk\SSOToken;

try {

	$appSecret = 'abcdef012345='; // the public key received from Staffbase.

	$sso = new SSOToken($appSecret, $_GET['jwt']);
	print "Hello again ". $sso->getFullName();

} catch (Exception $e) {

	print "Sorry we could not authenticate You.";
	exit;
}
```

To manage multiple instances easy and secure we provide a convenience class which abstracts the session.
The `PluginSession` class has the same data interface as `SSOToken`. It also provides the means to set a custom session save handler as the optional third parameter of `__construct`. `PluginSession` will automatically take care of reading the URL parameters and saving the SSO info in the session for further requests after the Token gets invalid.

```php
use Exception;
use Staffbase\plugins\sdk\PluginSession;

try {

	$pluginId  = 'weatherplugin'; // the id you received from Staffbase.
	$appSecret = 'abcdef012345='; // the public key received from Staffbase.

	$session = new PluginSession($pluginId, $appSecret);

	print "Hello again ". $PluginSession->getFullName(). ', '. $PluginSession->getSessionVar('message');

} catch (Exception $e) {

	print "Sorry we could not authenticate You.";
	exit;
}
```
